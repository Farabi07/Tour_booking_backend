When contacted they refused to refund the childs part of the money. I will not recommend \"Dream Tourism\" for your trip needs.",

You are only given a ticket to enter through regluar entrance instead of group which for some reason could or could not be longer than the “skip the line”. I was charced 48 dolars for each ticket, while the official ticket (which they sent me when I wanted to go in) only costs 18… what did i pay for? Viators fees? Personally, a scam for me.",

Getting a skip the line ticket is a must as the queues were crazy. The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill was an unexpected magical bonus.

    "text": "Thinking of using Dream Tourism to skip the lines? Here's what you should know first... Dream Tourism offers a service to help you avoid ticket lines, but be aware that their process might not be what you expect. While I confirmed payment and expected downloadable tickets, I received instructions instead. This lack of clarity caused some concern, and I even opened a PayPal case (which I later canceled). Thankfully, Dream Tourism did come through with the actual tickets. However, the experience between purchasing and receiving them was stressful. While their service lets you skip the very long lines (which is a big plus!), Note that you're paying double the price for these tickets. (also note that kids get in free anyway). If you're flexible with timing, you can potentially save money by buying directly from the source, \"Coopculture.it\"",

I left a 3* review and was called by the company asking why I left a 3* review… this is a week after I used their services.

They sent us the voucher by email (this does not get you admission), but then we also needed tickets sent to us. When we didn't receive the tickets by the day of our tour, we called them and they gave us the run-around for several hours. Admission is only allowed until 15 minutes after the time printed on the ticket. Fortunately, a representative from Trip Advisor was able to locate and send us the tickets at the last second. The audio quality of the tour is very poor and the disposable headsets did not fit my or my wife's ears. We ended up just walking around and looking at the sites. The Roman Forum and Palatine hill were very interesting and full of ancient history.",

    "text": "Dream Tourism ran this excursion. We had one day to go to Capri. We woke up at 5am to get ready to meet the group at a location that was designated on our tour voucher. We left our hotel at 6am to walk the 22 min to the meeting spot, Boone was there. We waited and no one showed. We called Viator and they called Dream Tourism. Dream tourism said they canceled the tour because it was too cold. It was a bit cool because it was early morning, but by the time we would’ve gotten to Capri it would’ve been in the 80s or upper 70s which would’ve been perfect weather. The tour guide told a fib, because he actually canceled because there were only four of us that had signed up. He canceled because not enough people signed up. Our complaint is that we were not told in time. It was only after we called that he sent an email out to us stating that the tour had been canceled. This is not good customer service, and ruined our beautiful day we had planned !!! I do not recommend doing anything with dream tourism, they cannot be trusted. I understand the need to cancel, if the trip didn’t fill up, but we should’ve been given plenty of notice!!!!!",

    "text": "Very confusing options, thought I had booked for a guided tour, discovered it wasn't even with an audio guide. Complained to the company, agreed to \"upgrade\" us to premium to include an audio guide, for free (well, for a 5* review). \"Tickets\" didn't arrive until a couple of hours before the tour. Timing was confusing - we thought we would be doing the Colosseum first, then the Roman Forum and Palatine Hills, instructions said otherwise, so we had to be there earlier than anticipated, to be at the Colosseum at our booked time. Told us we'd need an hour for the Forum and Palatine, but you really need much longer. The assistants at the gate told us we'd need longer and should do the Colosseum first and do the others when we were ready (we decided to just do a quick tour of the Forum and Palatine rather than to and fro again). Skip the Line at the Colosseum worked well, but there was a wait for the audio guides. However, it's well worth the visit for all the history and magnificence of the building. I would recommend just buy the skip the line tickets with audio guide from the official site and save the extra hassle.",
